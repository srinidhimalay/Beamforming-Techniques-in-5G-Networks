# Beamforming-Techniques-in-5G-Networks
This project is a Python-based GUI application for simulating and visualizing beamforming techniques in 5G networks. Using the Tkinter library, it allows users to input various parameters related to antenna arrays, signal properties, and beamforming techniques. The program supports three beamforming techniques: Conventional, Adaptive, and Hybrid.

The application calculates the beam patterns for each technique and displays them on polar and Cartesian plots using Matplotlib. It also allows the user to run simulations, view results in real-time, and export the resulting plots to PNG files.

Key Features:

User Interface: A clean, interactive interface built with Tkinter, allowing for easy input of antenna configuration, signal parameters, and beamforming settings.
Simulation: The program simulates beamforming techniques, including conventional beamforming, adaptive beamforming (Minimum Variance Distortionless Response - MVDR), and hybrid beamforming.
Visualization: Results are presented on both polar and Cartesian plots, providing insights into the beam patterns.
Export: Users can export the simulation results as high-quality PNG files for further analysis or presentation.
The application is designed to help users understand the behavior of different beamforming strategies in 5G communication systems and visualize their performance in real-time.
